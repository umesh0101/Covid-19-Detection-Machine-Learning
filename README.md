# Covid-19-Detection-Machine-Learning

- Developed a GUI application for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray image, includes buttons for browse, classify, and training an image.
- Utilised Keras for CNN, preprocessed with resizing images to 128x128 pixel, rotation, shearing, giving probabilities for Normal and Covid State.
